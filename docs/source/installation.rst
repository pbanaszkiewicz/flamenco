Installation
============

Flamenco requires quite recent Python version: 2.7 or 3.3.  It should work with
earlier versions, but the codebase isn't tested against them, so be careful.

At the command line::

    $ pip install flamenco

Or, if you have virtualenvwrapper installed::

    $ mkvirtualenv flamenco
    $ pip install flamenco
